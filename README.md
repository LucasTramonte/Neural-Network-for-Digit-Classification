## Question 4

Now we're developing a compact neural network model to identify the language of individual words. Our dataset comprises words from five languages, as shown in the table below:

| Word       | Language |
|------------|----------|
| discussed  | English  |
| eternidad  | Spanish  |
| itseänne   | Finnish  |
| paleis     | Dutch    |
| mieszkać   | Polish   |
